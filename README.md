<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Space Travelers <a name="about-project"></a>

![Alt text](src/img/home.png)
**[Space Travelers]** is a project that was created inline with the Microverse curriculumn. This app shows a list of rockets that can be reserved and missions that can be joined. As the user clicks on the various NavLinks, the different components are rendered. Data is fetched from the API and set as the new state. The components then access the data and render it using child components created in react. Global state is managed through Redux. I used React and redux in this project. 

# Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>
